Subject: [PATCH 0/3] efi_loader: event services

Currently U-Boot only allows a single event. This is sufficient to run
grub but not for other workloads as iPXE.

The EFI_SIMPLE_TEXT_INPUT_PROTOCOL requires an event WaitForKey. This
is used for instance by the iPXE shell.

With the 1st patch events are stored in an array. Four events seems to be
enough for now.

The 2nd patch implements the WaitForKey event for
the EFI_SIMPLE_TEXT_INPUT_PROTOCOL.

The 3rd patch disables debug output for the WaitForKey event in function
efi_check_event.

Heinrich Schuchardt (3):
  efi_loader: implement multiple event support
  efi_loader: implement WaitForKey
  efi_loader: no debug message on wait for key
